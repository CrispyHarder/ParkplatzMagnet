# ParkplatzMagnet
This was a small project I did when i had a little bit too much free time on my hands. 
The goal was to train a neural network that would be able to detect if someone was using a parking space only using sensor data from a magnetic coil, since at night a daylight
would not be of any use. 
I got unlabeled data which consisted of 4 features: 3 from the coil and 1 from a daylight sensor. 
First I preprocessed and labeled the day-data by using the daylight sensor and then trained multiple models on it. 
After a lot of trial and error with different approaches on modeling the data, I got good results. 
After some time, university came up again and i was not able to finish the multiple ideas i had left on improving the results.
